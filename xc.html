    <p>Cross country bikes are designed for riders who want to cover long distances and ride on less technical terrains. 
        They are typically lightweight and have less suspension travel than other types of mountain bikes, 
        making them ideal for riders who want a bike that is efficient and fast. 
        Cross country bikes are perfect for riders who want to tackle long climbs and enjoy fast descents, 
        and are a great choice for riders who want a bike that handles quickly and responds to every instruction.</p>
