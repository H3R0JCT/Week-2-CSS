    <p>Enduro bikes are designed for riders who want to tackle technical descents and challenging terrain. 
        They are built to handle rough trails and steep drops, making them ideal for riders who want a bike that can handle anything they throw at it. 
        Enduro bikes are typically heavier and have more suspension travel than other types of mountain bikes, 
        making them perfect for riders who want to push their limits and take on the most challenging downhill trails.</p>
